# Link Tree

This project is a simple **Link Tree** webpage that displays links to various profiles like GitHub, LinkedIn, and Fiverr. The page features a clean design with a customizable profile image and typing animation for the title.

## Files
1. **index.html** - The main HTML file.
2. **style.css** - The stylesheet for styling the page.
3. **script.js** - The JavaScript file for handling animations.
4. **dracula.png** - An image used as the profile picture.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The page adapts to different screen sizes with the help of the `meta viewport` tag.
- **Profile Links**: Links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and Fiverr profiles that open in new tabs.
- **Typing Animation**: A typing effect that dynamically displays a title.
- **Favicon**: A custom favicon (dracula.png) for the page tab.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Replace the links in the HTML file with your own social or professional links.
3. Customize the `dracula.png` file with your own profile image (if needed).
4. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Requirements
